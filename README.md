## ABOUT SEEFOOD
SeeFood is a technology company that connects people and restaurants. We do this by empowering local restaurants to showcase their menus and dishes on our platform and in turn, give their customers and guests a better dinning experience.
Growing every day, we currently focus and serve the Monterey Bay Area. We are adding new restaurant partners and menus weekly.
